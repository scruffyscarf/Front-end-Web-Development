        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Maxim and I am a student at Innopolis University.
        Since the 9th grade, I began to get interested in programming and Python and Java became the first programming languages for me.
        By participating in various competitions and olympiads, I gained experience, which contributed to arousing more interest in programming.
        This interest  led me not only to a deep dive into IT, but also awakened in me the desire to become a sought-after specialist in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
        My goal is to become an information technology specialist who is able not only to solve complex problems, but also to make a great contribution to the development of the IT sphere.
        I am sure that my experience and passion for programming will help me achieve all my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
        In my free time, I devote to developing my creative skills.
        One of my hobbies is writing a book related to human psychology.
        I strive to combine the knowledge gained during my studies with personal qualities in order to create something new that will be useful to all people.

        <h3>Project Satellite</h3>
        <p>
            The Project Satellite is a comprehensive study aimed at modeling satellite orbits around Earth using MATLAB software.
            The primary goal of this project is to create a detailed model of Earth and its satellites, along with analyzing their orbital motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key components of the project:
            Implementation of a three-dimensional Earth model considering its physical characteristics, such as radius, mass, and shape.
            Simulation of satellite trajectories around Earth, including calculation of their orbital parameters.
            Study of the dynamics of satellite movement, taking into account Earth's gravity and other factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Goals and Tasks:
            Development of an accurate Earth and satellite model.
            Simulation and analysis of satellite trajectory movements.
            Investigation of various parameters' influence on satellite movement.
            Visualization of simulation results for better understanding of the processes involved.
            The Project_Satellite is a comprehensive study aimed at modeling satellite orbits around Earth using MATLAB software.
            The primary goal of this project is to create a detailed model of Earth and its satellites, along with analyzing their orbital motion.

        <h3>Daily Meeting Telegram Bot</h3>
        <p>
            Daily Meeting Telegram Bot is a project that I am making right now.
            Software_Project is aimed at creating a bot using Python.
            The bot's main function is to automate the distribution of reminders for command tasks at predetermined times by users.
            It informs users about the current status of tasks, the remaining time until completion, and other pertinent information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key Features:
            The bot sends reminders for task execution at set times. Users can configure reminders for various tasks.
            Task Tracking: The bot tracks the status of each task, notifying users of pending tasks.
            Utilizes a database to store participant information, tasks, and reminders, facilitating easy data management and accurate information dissemination.
